# Introduction to the numpy-random package
An exploration of the numpy.random package as part of course requirements Programming for Data Analytics for GMIT Higher Diploma in Data Analysis 2019 - 2020.

# Prerequisites for the Project
Using the Jupyter Notebook package, the numpy-random package and its uses are documented with examples of the functions given. To utilise this repository, the following packages are required. These packages may already be available to the user if Anaconda is the default package in which Python was downloaded. 

numpy - Installed from: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy

jupyter - Installed from: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jupyter 

Running Jupyter: 
Jupyter is a Python package. Unlike many Python packages, Jupyter is installed on your computer in a way that does not require your machine to import it from Python. Jupyter can be imported but typicaaly Jupyter is run from the machine's command line.

How it works: 
Once called, the Jupyter Notebook will open a tab on the machine's internet browser. This enables you to access the Jupyter package. If the new tab does not appear, copy the url given on the command line and paste that in the address bar of the internet browser. It is important to note that whatever folder Jupyter is opened in. 

To begin using Jupyter, a new file can be opened from the web page. 


# Overview of the Jupyter Notebook.

The aim of the Jupyter Notebook is to provide an explaination of the numpy.random package with is part of the NumPy programme package. The Notebook contains: 

Background and Overivew of NumPy
Section 1: Introduction and Explaination of the numpy.random package
Section 2: Explaination of the 'Smple Random Data'and "Permutation" functions
Section 3: Explaination of 5 'Distributions'functions
                              Binomial 
                              Chi square
                              Exponention
                              Uniform
                              Wald
Section 4: Explaination of the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers
